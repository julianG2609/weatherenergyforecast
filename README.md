#Intro
The global shift towards clean and renewable energy sources has highlighted
the role of solar energy in fostering environmental sustainability. This practical
assignment focuses on the development of machine learning models with the
capability to accurately predict the hourly electrical energy output generated by
solar panels and fed into the electrical grid.
The aim of this practical work is to raise awareness and motivate students to
design and develop a Machine Learning project using, among other things, the
learning models covered throughout the semester.
The dataset utilized for this project encompasses data related to energy produc-
tion from specific solar panels in the city of Braga, spanning from September
2021 to April 2023.

#Overview
The aim was to develop the best possible model capable of
predicting the amount of energy, in kWh, produced by solar panels and injected
into existing electricity grids at each hour of the day.
So, the primary objective of this project is developing models that enhance
the efficiency of solar energy utilization by accurately predicting the amount of
energy generated by solar panels.
To achieve scores in the competition, each group should predict, for each record
in the test dataset ("energia_202301-202304.csv"), the amount of energy injected
into the electrical network at a specific point in time, using the scale None, Low,
Medium, High, and Very_High.

#Conclusion
We managed to get good results by our approach on improving our models step by
step. To further improve the prediction performance, we could consider expanding
the dataset to include more data from various geographical regions and different
moments throughout the year. Incorporating data from different moments
throughout the year, considering seasonal variations, is pivotal for improving
the models’ adaptability to dynamic solar energy patterns. Recognizing the
impact of changing sunlight duration, temperature fluctuations, and weather
conditions during different seasons enhances the models’ ability to provide better
predictions. Exposure to data from various geographical regions and different
times of the year encourages the models to generalize well across diverse scenarios.
This generalization is crucial when deploying predictive models in real-world
applications, ensuring their effectiveness in unforeseen conditions and locations.
